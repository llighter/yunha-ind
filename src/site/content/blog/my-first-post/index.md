A great deal of talent is lost in the world for want of a little courage.

Hi my name is Park, Yunha.
I'm the owner of this website.
Welcome to all of you guys.
Feel free to seeing around.


``` js
// this is the comment
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    console.log(entry);
  }
})

observer.observe({type: 'layout-shift', buffered: true});
```

{% Aside 'codelab' %}
Technically, this test will also pass if your site contains any
`h1`-`h6` elements or any of the HTML5 landmark
elements. But although the test is vague in its requirements, it's still
nice to pass it if you can!
{% endAside %}


Thank you.
